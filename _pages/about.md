I am a Teaching Fellow in the Department of Government at the LSE, where I teach seminars for Introduction to Political Science (GV101). I completed my PhD in Political and Social Sciences at the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence, and hold an MPhil in European Politics from the University of Oxford. I was also a Fulbright Fellow at Stanford University.

My research explores the origins and persistence of meritocratic beliefs in the face of growing inequality and declining social mobility. I use experimental methods to investigate public attitudes toward fairness and inequality, including housing inequality (motivated in no small part by the mess that is London housing). My research on this topic combines survey and Twitter data to trace how attitudes about the fairness of the economic system respond to increasing visible wealth inequality.

A second strand of my work focuses on the politics of memory. With Ludwig Schulze (EUI), I study how framing Germany’s past from a perpetrator versus victim perspective influences authoritarian attitudes and support for the AfD. With Giuliano Formisano (Oxford), I examine how Italian political discourse around fascism and anti-fascism has evolved in parliament over time, and how parties have mobilised historical narratives in response to contemporary events.

**Research interests:**
* Public attitudes on fairness, inequality and redistribution
