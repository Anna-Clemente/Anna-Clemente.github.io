I am a Teaching Fellow in the Department of Government at the LSE, where I teach seminars for Introduction to Political Science (GV101). I completed my PhD in Political and Social Sciences at the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence, and hold an MPhil in European Politics from the University of Oxford. I was also a Fulbright Fellow at Stanford University.

My research explores the origins and persistence of meritocratic beliefs in the face of growing inequality and declining social mobility. I use experimental methods to investigate public attitudes toward fairness and inequality, including housing inequality (motivated in no small part by the mess that is London housing). My research on this topic combines survey and Twitter data to trace how attitudes about the fairness of the economic system respond to increasing visible wealth inequality.

A second strand of my work focuses on the politics of memory. With Ludwig Schulze (EUI), I study how framing Germany’s past from a perpetrator versus victim perspective influences authoritarian attitudes and support for the AfD. With Giuliano Formisano (Oxford), I examine how Italian political discourse around fascism and anti-fascism has evolved in parliament over time, and how parties have mobilised historical narratives in response to contemporary events.

*Caring about inequality: Income shocks and changes in meritocratic beliefs*  
<div style="text-align: justify;">
After economic shocks, we expect increases in demand for redistribution. Prominent explanations include desire for insurance and compensation or a revaluation of the fairness of the economy (Margalit, 2019). Inequity aversion (the dislike for unequal outcomes) has not been properly addressed as a potential mechanism. I propose that during adverse economic circumstances individuals become more sensitive to overall levels of inequality, independently of how inequality was achieved. Simply put, merit matters less in justifying unequal outcomes after an economic shock. I test this through a survey experiment conducted in the UK and in the US. The study disentangles change driven by learning from inequity aversion. Among British participants, the shock increases redistribution by acting on inequity aversion rather than updated priors. A randomised prime, connecting the experimental loss to the real world, activates the effect of the shock. Results indicate support for meritocracy may not be as stable as assumed.

*Mind the Bricks: Fairness Beliefs and Local Housing Inequality in the UK*  
*With Giuliano Formisano*  
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Raising mortgage costs and rents across Western countries have increased the salience of housing among the public. While housing matters for the politics of redistribution as a form of wealth, its role in informing perceptions of the fairness of the economic system is understudied. As unaffordability increases, people may perceive that even playing by the rules of the economic system is not enough. A local context of wealth inequality, exposing the disparity of rewards, may make salient the sharp differences between winners and losers. This is compounded by the uneven housing supply, which is mainly targeted to the winners of globalisation, changing the character of areas. We focus on inequality linked to housing prices as an example of wealth acquired through mechanisms of accumulation based on booming property prices, disconnected from individual effort. We study whether individuals in places where inequality has increased the most see inequality as unfair and demand more redistribution. We find this is the case in the British context, using survey data and supervised machine learning methods on Twitter data. Where the Gini of housing prices has increased the most, individuals are more likely to advocate for fairness when discussing economic issues. This shows housing matters not only on a material level, but also for structuring beliefs in the fairness of the economic system.

*The scale of fairness: examining preferences for competing egalitarian and meritocratic narratives*  
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Lack of redistribution in the American context is often attributed to Americans’ propensity to think of individual mobility out of poverty as determined by the presence of opportunity rather than welfare assistance (McCall, 2013). This belief, however, is at least partly informed by how parties talk about these issues. Despite deep divisions between parties, the discourse on meritocracy and equality of opportunity is consensual, so that voters are not presented with competing interpretations of equality. Does the success of meritocratic narratives depend on the absence of competitive alternatives or rather on them being read as more convincing and closer to one’s own experience? This study tests the persuasiveness of competing narratives related to equality of opportunity and sufficiency of outcomes. Results reveal that the description of meritocracy as the prevailing American ethos is unjustified, and that a small majority prefers egalitarian narratives.
