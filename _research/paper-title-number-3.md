Lack of redistribution in the American context is often attributed to Americans’ propensity to think of individual mobility out of poverty as determined by the presence of opportunity rather than welfare assistance (McCall, 2013). This belief, however, is at least partly informed by how parties talk about these issues. Despite deep divisions between parties, the discourse on meritocracy and equality of opportunity is consensual, so that voters are not presented with competing interpretations of equality. Does the success of meritocratic narratives depend on the absence of competitive alternatives or rather on them being read as more convincing and closer to one’s own experience? This study tests the persuasiveness of competing narratives related to equality of opportunity and sufficiency of outcomes. Results reveal that the description of meritocracy as the prevailing American ethos is unjustified, and that a small majority prefers egalitarian narratives.
