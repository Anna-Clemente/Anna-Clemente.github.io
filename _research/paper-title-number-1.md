After economic shocks, we expect increases in demand for redistribution. Prominent explanations include desire for insurance and compensation or a revaluation of the fairness of the economy (Margalit, 2019). Inequity aversion (the dislike for unequal outcomes) has not been properly addressed as a potential mechanism. I propose that during adverse economic circumstances individuals become more sensitive to overall levels of inequality, independently of how inequality was achieved. Simply put, merit matters less in justifying unequal outcomes after an economic shock. I test this through a survey experiment conducted in the UK and in the US. The study disentangles change driven by learning from inequity aversion. Among British participants, the shock increases redistribution by acting on inequity aversion rather than updated priors. A randomised prime, connecting the experimental loss to the real world, activates the effect of the shock. Results indicate support for meritocracy may not be as stable as assumed.
